Edge AI and TinyML

Introduction:

Edge AI refers to artificial intelligence algorithms processed locally on hardware devices rather than relying on cloud-based computing. TinyML (Tiny Machine Learning) is a subset of edge AI that focuses on running machine learning models on extremely resource-constrained devices like microcontrollers.

What is Edge AI?

Edge AI brings computation and data storage closer to the location where it is needed, improving response times and saving bandwidth. Instead of sending data to centralized cloud servers for processing, the AI model runs directly on the device or nearby edge server.
