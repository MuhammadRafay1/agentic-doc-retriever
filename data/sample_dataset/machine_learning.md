# Machine Learning Fundamentals

## What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to improve their performance on a specific task through experience, without being explicitly programmed.

## Types of Machine Learning

### 1. Supervised Learning
In supervised learning, the algorithm learns from labeled training data. The model makes predictions or decisions based on input data and receives feedback through labeled outputs.

**Common Algorithms:**
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests
- Neural Networks

**Applications:**
- Email spam classification
- Credit scoring
- Medical diagnosis
- Image recognition

### 2. Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning algorithms work with unlabeled data, finding hidden patterns or intrinsic structures in the input data.

**Common Algorithms:**
- K-Means Clustering
- Hierarchical Clustering
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Association Rules

**Applications:**
- Customer segmentation
- Anomaly detection
- Recommendation systems
- Dimensionality reduction

### 3. Reinforcement Learning
The algorithm learns by interacting with an environment, receiving rewards or penalties for actions, and adjusting its strategy to maximize cumulative reward.

**Common Algorithms:**
- Q-Learning
- Deep Q-Networks (DQN)
- Policy Gradients
- Actor-Critic Methods

**Applications:**
- Game playing (AlphaGo, Chess)
- Robotics
- Autonomous driving
- Resource management

## Key Concepts

### Training and Testing
- **Training Set**: Data used to train the model
- **Validation Set**: Data used to tune hyperparameters
- **Test Set**: Data used to evaluate final model performance

### Overfitting and Underfitting
- **Overfitting**: Model performs well on training data but poorly on new data
- **Underfitting**: Model is too simple to capture the underlying pattern

### Evaluation Metrics
- **Classification**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC
- **Regression**: Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), R-squared
