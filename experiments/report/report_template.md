[Write 1-2 paragraphs describing what you built and how it addresses the requirements]

---

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 Components

Describe the main components of your system:
- **Document Loader:** [How documents are loaded and processed]
- **Embedding Engine:** [How embeddings are generated]
- **Vector Store:** [How documents are indexed and stored]
- **Search Interface:** [How queries are processed]

### 2.2 Technology Stack

List the key technologies used:
- Embedding Models: [List models tested]
- Vector Databases: [FAISS, ChromaDB, or both]
- Framework: LangChain
- GUI: Tkinter

## 3. Experiments and Analysis

### 3.1 Embedding Model Comparison

Test at least 3 different embedding models with the same dataset and queries.

**Models Tested:**
1. [Model 1 Name]
2. [Model 2 Name]
3. [Model 3 Name]

**Test Query 1:** "[Your query]"

| Model | Top-1 Result | Relevance Score | Observation |
|-------|-------------|----------------|-------------|
| Model 1 | [Document name] | [Score] | [Quality assessment] |
| Model 2 | [Document name] | [Score] | [Quality assessment] |
| Model 3 | [Document name] | [Score] | [Quality assessment] |

**Test Query 2:** "[Your query]"

[Repeat table for second query]

**Analysis:**
- Which model performed best? Why do you think so?
- How did results differ between models?
- What patterns did you observe?

### 3.2 Vector Store Comparison

Compare FAISS vs ChromaDB performance.

**Observations:**

| Aspect | FAISS | ChromaDB |
|--------|-------|----------|
| Indexing Speed | [Observation] | [Observation] |
| Search Speed | [Observation] | [Observation] |
| Ease of Use | [Observation] | [Observation] |
| Result Quality | [Observation] | [Observation] |

**Analysis:**
- Which vector store would you recommend for this use case? Why?

### 3.3 Dataset Analysis

**Dataset Used:**
- Number of documents: [count]
- File types: [types]
- Total size: [size]
- Domain/Topic: [description]

**Query Effectiveness:**

Test different types of queries:
1. **Broad Query:** "[Example]" - [Observation about results]
2. **Specific Query:** "[Example]" - [Observation about results]
3. **Technical Query:** "[Example]" - [Observation about results]
